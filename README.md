# Barcode_Detection_using_Image_Processing
Barcodes are prevalent across industries for tasks such as inventory tracking, product identification, and data encoding. 
Despite their simplicity, extracting and decoding barcodes from raw images poses challenges due to variations in lighting, orientation, noise, and image quality.
This project addresses the problem of reliably detecting and decoding 1D barcodes from images using a combination of classical image processing techniques and barcode decoding libraries.
